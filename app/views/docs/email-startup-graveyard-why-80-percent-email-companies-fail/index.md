# The Email Startup Graveyard: Why 80%+ of Email Companies Fail

<img loading="lazy" src="/img/articles/email-startup-graveyard.webp" alt="" class="rounded-lg" />

<p class="lead mt-3">While many email startups have invested millions in solving perceived problems, we at <a href="https://forwardemail.net">Forward Email</a> have focused on building reliable email infrastructure from scratch since 2017. This analysis explores the patterns behind email startup outcomes and the fundamental challenges of email infrastructure.</p>

> \[!NOTE]
> **Key Insight**: Most email startups don't build actual email infrastructure from scratch. Many build on top of existing solutions like Amazon SES or open-source systems like Postfix. The core protocols work well - the challenge is in the implementation.

## Building Modern Infrastructure for Existing Email Protocols: Our Approach

Before diving into the failures, it's important to understand what actually works in email. The challenge isn't that email is broken - it's that most companies try to "fix" something that already works perfectly.

### The Email Innovation Spectrum

Email innovation falls into three categories:

1. **Infrastructure Enhancement** (What works): Building better servers, delivery systems, and developer tools
2. **Workflow Integration** (Sometimes works): Adding email to existing business processes
3. **Protocol Replacement** (Always fails): Trying to replace SMTP, IMAP, or POP3

### Why We Focus on Infrastructure

We chose to build modern email infrastructure because:

* **Email protocols are proven**: SMTP has worked reliably since 1982
* **The problem is implementation**: Most email services use outdated software stacks
* **Users want reliability**: Not new features that break existing workflows
* **Developers need tools**: Better APIs and management interfaces

### What Actually Works in Email

The successful pattern is simple: **enhance existing email workflows instead of replacing them**. This means:

* Building faster, more reliable SMTP servers
* Creating better spam filtering without breaking legitimate email
* Providing developer-friendly APIs for existing protocols
* Improving deliverability through proper infrastructure


## The Email Startup Failure Matrix

Here's every major email startup failure we could find, organized by accelerator, funding, and outcome:

| Company           | Year | Accelerator | Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Outcome                                                                                  | Status    | Key Issue                                                                                                                  |

## The Infrastructure Reality Check

Here's what nobody talks about: **every single "email startup" is just building UI on top of existing infrastructure**.

### What Actually Runs Email

* **Amazon SES**: Powers most "email APIs" and services
* **Postfix**: The actual SMTP server running everywhere
* **Cyrus IMAP**: What handles your actual email storage
* **SpamAssassin**: What filters your spam
* **DKIM/SPF/DMARC**: The authentication that actually works

### What "Email Startups" Actually Build

* React Native apps with memory leaks
* Web interfaces that break email threading
* "AI" features that Gmail already has
* "Security" layers that break existing workflows
* APIs that wrap Amazon SES with 10x markup

> \[!TIP]
> **Key Pattern for Email Success**: The companies that actually succeed in email don't try to reinvent the wheel. Instead, they build **infrastructure and tools that enhance** existing email workflows. SendGrid, Mailgun, and Postmark became billion-dollar companies by providing reliable SMTP APIs and delivery services - they work **with** email protocols, not against them. This is the same approach we take at Forward Email.


## Case Study: The Skiff Disaster

Skiff perfectly exemplifies everything wrong with email startups.

### The Setup

* **Positioning**: "Privacy-first email and productivity platform"
* **Funding**: Significant venture capital
* **Promise**: Better email through privacy and encryption

### The Acquisition

[Notion acquired Skiff in February 2024](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/notion-acquires-privacy-focused-productivity-platform-skiff/) with typical acquisition promises about integration and continued development.

### The Reality

* **Immediate shutdown**: [Skiff shut down within months](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/1ap3wqf/skiff_is_shutting_down_how_to_migrate_to_proton/)
* **Founder exodus**: [Skiff founders left Notion and joined Cursor](https://x.com/skeptrune/status/1939763513695903946)
* **User abandonment**: Thousands of users forced to migrate


## The Accelerator Analysis

### Y Combinator: The Email App Factory

Y Combinator has funded dozens of email startups. Here's the pattern:

* **Emailio** (2014): Mobile email client â†’ pivoted to "wellness"
* **MailTime** (2016): Chat-style email â†’ pivoted to analytics
* **reMail** (2009): iPhone email search â†’ acquired by Google â†’ shutdown
* **Rapportive** (2012): Gmail social profiles â†’ acquired by LinkedIn â†’ shutdown

**Success Rate**: Several large acquisitions. Most pivot away from email or get acqui-hired.

### Techstars: The Email Graveyard

Techstars has an even worse track record:

* **Email Copilot** (2012): Acquired â†’ shutdown
* **ReplySend** (2012): Failed completely
* **Nveloped** (2012): "Easy. Secure. Email" â†’ failed
* **Jumble** (2015): Email encryption â†’ failed
* **InboxFever** (2011): Email API â†’ failed

**Pattern**: Vague value propositions, no real technical innovation, quick failures.


## Why Email Startups Always Fail

### 1. Email Isn't Broken

The fundamental assumption is wrong. Email works perfectly:

* **Universal compatibility**: Every device, every platform
* **Dummy-proof**: Status codes (e.g. 421) and queues allow retries
* **Standardized**: SMTP, IMAP, POP3 are battle-tested
* **Reliable**: Billions of emails sent daily without issues

### 2. Network Effects Are Unbreakable

Email's network effect is absolute:

* **Everyone has email**: 4+ billion email users worldwide
* **Cross-platform**: Works between all providers
* **Business critical**: Companies depend on email reliability
* **Switching cost**: Changing email addresses breaks everything

### 3. They're Solving Non-Problems

Most email startups target imaginary issues:

* **"Email is too complex"**: It's not. Send, receive, organize.
* **"Email needs AI"**: Gmail already has smart features
* **"Email needs better security"**: DKIM/SPF/DMARC work fine
* **"Email needs a new interface"**: Outlook/Gmail interfaces are optimized

### 4. Technical Debt Is Massive

Building real email infrastructure requires:

* **SMTP servers**: Complex delivery and reputation management
* **Spam filtering**: Constantly evolving threat landscape
* **Storage systems**: Reliable IMAP/POP3 implementation
* **Authentication**: DKIM, SPF, DMARC, ARC compliance
* **Deliverability**: ISP relationships and reputation management

### 5. The Infrastructure Already Exists

Why reinvent when you can use:

* **Amazon SES**: Proven delivery infrastructure
* **Postfix**: Battle-tested SMTP server
* **Dovecot**: Reliable IMAP/POP3 server
* **SpamAssassin**: Effective spam filtering
* **Existing providers**: Gmail, Outlook, FastMail work fine


## The Venture Capital Trap

VCs love email startups because they sound simple but are actually impossible:

* **Large market**: "Everyone uses email!"
* **Clear problem**: "Email is old and broken!"
* **Technical moat**: "We'll build better infrastructure!"
* **Network effects**: "Once we get users, we'll dominate!"

**Reality**: None of these assumptions hold true for email.


## The Technical Reality: Modern Email Stacks

### What Actually Powers "Email Startups"

Let's look at what these companies actually run:

```
# What most "email startups" actually run
[React Native App] â†’ [Node.js API] â†’ [Amazon SES] â†’ [Existing Email Infrastructure]
```

```
# What we actually run*
[100% Custom Node.js JavaScript Stack Built From Scratch]
```

\* **[Our technical whitepaper](https://forwardemail.net/technical-whitepaper.pdf) explains our complete infrastructure**

### The Performance Problems

**Memory Bloat**: Most email apps are Electron-based web apps that consume massive amounts of RAM:

* **Mailspring**: [500MB+](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/issues/1758) for basic email
* **Nylas Mail**: [1GB+](https://fuzzyblog.io/blog/email/2017/01/18/nylas-mail-review.html) memory usage
* **Postbox**: [300MB+](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/postbox-why-does-it-take-up-so-much-ram.1411335/) idle memory
* **Canary Mail**: [Frequent crashes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanaryMail/comments/10pe7jf/canary_is_crashing_on_all_my_devices/) due to memory issues

**Battery Drain**: Constant syncing and inefficient code:

* Background processes that never sleep
* Unnecessary API calls every few seconds
* Poor connection management
* No third-party dependencies except those absolutely required for core functionality


## The Acquisition-to-Shutdown Pipeline

### The Standard Pattern

1. **Launch**: "Revolutionary email experience"
2. **Funding**: Raise $5-50M from VCs
3. **Growth**: Acquire some users, burn through cash
4. **Acquisition**: Larger company buys for talent/features
5. **Integration**: "We're excited to integrate..."
6. **Shutdown**: Service discontinued within 12 months

### Recent Examples

* **Mailbox â†’ Dropbox â†’ Shutdown** (2013-2015)
* **Sparrow â†’ Google â†’ Shutdown** (2012-2013)
* **reMail â†’ Google â†’ Shutdown** (2010-2011)
* **Skiff â†’ Notion â†’ Shutdown** (2024)


## Industry Evolution and Consolidation

### Natural Industry Progression

The email industry has naturally evolved toward consolidation, with larger companies acquiring smaller ones to integrate features or eliminate competition. This isn't necessarily negative - it's how most mature industries develop.

### Post-Acquisition Transitions

When email companies are acquired, users often face:

* **Service migrations**: Moving to new platforms
* **Feature changes**: Loss of specialized functionality
* **Pricing adjustments**: Different subscription models
* **Integration periods**: Temporary service disruptions

### User Considerations During Transitions

During industry consolidation, users benefit from:

* **Evaluating alternatives**: Multiple providers offer similar services
* **Understanding migration paths**: Most services provide export tools
* **Considering long-term stability**: Established providers often offer more continuity


## The Hacker News Reality Check

Every email startup gets the same comments on Hacker News:

* ["Email works fine, this solves a non-problem"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35982757)
* ["Just use Gmail/Outlook like everyone else"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35982757)
* ["Another email client that will be shut down in 2 years"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35982757)
* ["The real problem is spam, and this doesn't solve that"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35982757)

**The community is right**. These comments appear on every email startup launch because the fundamental problems are always the same.


## The Modern AI Email Grift

### The Latest Wave

2024 brought a new wave of "AI-powered email" startups:

* **Superhuman**: $33M raised, AI features on top of Gmail
* **Shortwave**: Gmail wrapper with AI summaries
* **SaneBox**: AI email filtering (actually works, but not revolutionary)

### The Same Old Problems

Adding "AI" doesn't solve email's fundamental non-problems:

* **AI summaries**: Most emails are already short
* **Smart replies**: Gmail has had these for years
* **Email scheduling**: Outlook does this natively
* **Priority detection**: Every email client has filters


## What Actually Works: The Real Email Success Stories

### Infrastructure Companies (The Winners)

* **SendGrid**: $3B acquisition by Twilio
* **Mailgun**: $50M+ revenue, acquired by Sinch
* **Postmark**: Profitable, acquired by ActiveCampaign
* **Amazon SES**: Billions in revenue

**Pattern**: They build infrastructure, not apps.

### Email Providers (The Survivors)

* **FastMail**: 25+ years, profitable, independent
* **ProtonMail**: Privacy-focused, sustainable growth
* **Zoho Mail**: Part of larger business suite
* **Forward Email** (us): 7+ years, profitable, growing

**Pattern**: They enhance email, don't replace it.

### The Exception: Xobni's Success Story

Xobni stands out as one of the few email-related startups that actually succeeded by taking the right approach.

**What Xobni Did Right**:

* **Enhanced existing email**: Built on top of Outlook instead of replacing it
* **Solved real problems**: Contact management and email search
* **Focused on integration**: Worked with existing workflows
* **Enterprise focus**: Targeted business users with real pain points

**The Success**: [Xobni was acquired by Yahoo for $60 million in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-xobni-for-around-60m-to-improve-yahoo-mail/), providing a solid return for investors and a successful exit for founders.

#### Why Xobni Succeeded Where Others Failed

1. **Built on proven infrastructure**: Used Outlook's existing email handling
2. **Solved actual problems**: Contact management was genuinely broken
3. **Enterprise market**: Businesses pay for productivity tools
4. **Integration approach**: Enhanced rather than replaced existing workflows

#### The Founders' Continued Success

Matt Brezina and Adam Smith didn't stop after Xobni:

* **Matt Brezina**: Became an active [angel investor](https://mercury.com/investor-database/matt-brezina) with investments in Dropbox, Mailbox, and others
* **Adam Smith**: Continued building successful companies in the productivity space
* **Both founders**: Demonstrated that email success comes from enhancement, not replacement

### The Pattern

Companies succeed in email when they:

1. **Build infrastructure** (SendGrid, Mailgun)
2. **Enhance existing workflows** (Xobni, FastMail)
3. **Focus on reliability** (Amazon SES, Postmark)
4. **Serve developers** (APIs and tools, not end-user apps)


## Has Anyone Successfully Reinvented Email?

This is a crucial question that gets to the heart of email innovation. The short answer is: **no one has successfully replaced email, but some have successfully enhanced it**.

### What Actually Stuck

Looking at email innovations over the past 20 years:

* **Gmail's threading**: Enhanced email organization
* **Outlook's calendar integration**: Enhanced scheduling
* **Mobile email apps**: Enhanced accessibility
* **DKIM/SPF/DMARC**: Enhanced security

**Pattern**: All successful innovations **enhanced** existing email protocols rather than replacing them.

### New Tools Complement Email (But Don't Replace It)

* **Slack**: Great for team chat, but still sends email notifications
* **Discord**: Excellent for communities, but uses email for account management
* **WhatsApp**: Perfect for messaging, but businesses still use email
* **Zoom**: Essential for video calls, but meeting invites come via email

### The Hey.com Experiment

Hey.com by Basecamp represents the most serious recent attempt to "reinvent" email:

* **Launched**: 2020 with significant fanfare
* **Approach**: Completely new email paradigm with screening, bundling, and workflows
* **Reception**: Mixed - some love it, most stick with existing email
* **Reality**: It's still email (SMTP/IMAP) with a different interface

**Interesting Note**: Hey.com's founder DHH actually uses our service at Forward Email for his personal domain `dhh.dk` and has for several years, demonstrating that even email innovators rely on proven infrastructure.

### What Actually Works

The most successful email innovations have been:

1. **Better infrastructure**: Faster servers, better spam filtering, improved deliverability
2. **Enhanced interfaces**: Gmail's conversation view, Outlook's calendar integration
3. **Developer tools**: APIs for sending email, webhooks for tracking
4. **Specialized workflows**: CRM integration, marketing automation, transactional email

**None of these replaced email - they made it better.**


## Our Approach: Why We're Different

### What We Do

* **Build actual infrastructure**: Custom SMTP/IMAP servers from scratch
* **Focus on reliability**: 99.99% uptime, proper error handling
* **Enhance existing workflows**: Work with all email clients
* **Serve developers**: APIs and tools that actually work
* **Maintain compatibility**: Full SMTP/IMAP/POP3 compliance

### What We Don't Do

* Build "revolutionary" email clients
* Try to replace existing email protocols
* Add unnecessary AI features
* Promise to "fix" email


## How We Build Email Infrastructure That Actually Works

### Our Anti-Startup Approach

While other companies burn millions trying to reinvent email, we focus on building reliable infrastructure:

* **No pivots**: We've been building email infrastructure for 7+ years
* **No acquisition strategy**: We're building for the long term
* **No "revolutionary" claims**: We just make email work better

### What Makes Us Different

**Technical Stack**:

```
# What Proton actually runs*
[postfix + custom-encryption + web-interface]
```

* \= [APNIC blog post](https://blog.apnic.net/2024/10/04/smtp-downgrade-attacks-and-mta-sts/#:\~:text=Logs%20indicate%20that%20Proton%20Mail%20uses%C2%A0postfix%2Dmta%2Dsts%2Dresolver%2C%20hinting%20that%20they%20run%20a%20Postfix%20stack) confirms Proton uses postfix-mta-sts-resolver, indicating they run a Postfix stack

**Our Stack**:

```
# What we actually run
[100% Custom Node.js JavaScript Stack Built From Scratch]
```

**Key Differences**:

* **Modern language**: JavaScript across the entire stack vs. 1980s C code
* **No glue code**: Single language eliminates integration complexity
* **Web-native**: Built for modern web development from the ground up
* **Maintainable**: Any web developer can understand and contribute
* **No legacy debt**: Clean, modern codebase without decades of patches

### The Technical Timeline

* **2017**: Started building custom SMTP server
* **2018**: Added IMAP support and spam filtering
* **2019**: Implemented DKIM/SPF/DMARC authentication
* **2020**: Added PGP encryption and security features
* **2021**: Built custom DNS management system
* **2022**: Implemented advanced anti-spam measures
* **2023**: Added enterprise features and API
* **2024**: Reached profitability and sustainable growth

### Why We Succeed Where Others Fail

1. **We build infrastructure, not apps**: Focus on servers and protocols
2. **We enhance, don't replace**: Work with existing email clients
3. **We're profitable**: No VC pressure to "grow fast and break things"
4. **We understand email**: 7+ years of deep technical experience
5. **We serve developers**: APIs and tools that actually solve problems

### The Cost Reality Check

**Typical Email Startup Burn Rate**:

* $500K-2M per month in VC funding
* 20-50 employees
* Expensive office space and perks
* Marketing and customer acquisition costs

**Our Approach**:

* Profitable from day one
* Small, focused team
* Remote-first, low overhead
* Organic growth through word-of-mouth


## Security Challenges in Email Infrastructure

Email security is a complex challenge that affects all providers in the industry. Rather than highlighting individual incidents, it's more valuable to understand the common security considerations that all email infrastructure providers must address.

### Common Security Considerations

All email providers face similar security challenges:

* **Data protection**: Securing user data and communications
* **Access control**: Managing authentication and authorization
* **Infrastructure security**: Protecting servers and databases
* **Compliance**: Meeting various regulatory requirements

### The Value of Transparency

When security incidents occur, the most valuable response is transparency and quick action. Companies that:

* **Disclose incidents promptly**: Help users make informed decisions
* **Provide detailed timelines**: Show they understand the scope of issues
* **Implement fixes quickly**: Demonstrate technical competence
* **Share lessons learned**: Contribute to industry-wide security improvements

These responses benefit the entire email ecosystem by promoting best practices and encouraging other providers to maintain high security standards.

### Ongoing Security Challenges

The email industry continues to evolve its security practices:

* **Encryption standards**: Implementing better encryption methods
* **Authentication protocols**: Improving DKIM, SPF, and DMARC
* **Threat detection**: Developing better spam and phishing filters
* **Infrastructure hardening**: Securing servers and databases

These challenges require ongoing investment and expertise from all providers in the space.


## Conclusion: Stop Building Email Apps

### The Evidence Is Overwhelming

After analyzing hundreds of email startups:

* **80%+ failure rate**: Most email startups fail completely
* **Acquisition = shutdown**: Being acquired usually means death
* **VC funding = pressure**: Venture capital creates unrealistic expectations
* **Technical debt = unsustainable**: Building email infrastructure is harder than it looks

### The Historical Context

Email has been "dying" for 20+ years according to startups:

* **2004**: "Social networks will replace email"
* **2008**: "Mobile messaging will kill email"
* **2012**: "Slack will replace email"
* **2016**: "AI will revolutionize email"
* **2020**: "Remote work needs new communication tools"
* **2024**: "AI will finally fix email"

**Email is still here**. It's still growing. It's still essential.

### The Real Lesson

The lesson isn't that email can't be improved. It's that:

1. **Email protocols work**: SMTP, IMAP, POP3 are battle-tested
2. **Infrastructure matters**: Reliability beats features
3. **Enhancement beats replacement**: Work with email, don't fight it
4. **Sustainability beats growth**: Profitable businesses outlast VC-funded ones

If you're thinking about building an email startup, consider building email infrastructure instead. The world needs better email servers, not more email apps.


## The Extended Email Graveyard: More Failures and Shutdowns

### Google's Email Experiments Gone Wrong

Google, despite owning Gmail, has killed multiple email projects:

* **Google Wave** (2009-2012): "Email killer" that nobody understood
* **Google Buzz** (2010-2011): Social email integration disaster
* **Inbox by Gmail** (2014-2019): Gmail's "smart" successor, abandoned
* **Google+** email features (2011-2019): Social network email integration

**Pattern**: Even Google can't successfully reinvent email.

### The Serial Failure: Newton Mail's Three Deaths

Newton Mail died **three times**:

1. **CloudMagic** (2013-2016): Email client acquired by Newton
2. **Newton Mail** (2016-2018): Rebranded, subscription model failed
3. **Newton Mail Revival** (2019-2020): Attempted comeback, failed again

**Lesson**: Email clients can't sustain subscription models.

### The Apps That Never Launched

Many email startups died before launching:

* **Tempo** (2014): Calendar-email integration, shut down pre-launch
* **Mailstrom** (2011): Email management tool, acquired before release
* **Fluent** (2013): Email client, development stopped

### The Acquisition-to-Shutdown Pattern

* **Sparrow â†’ Google â†’ Shutdown** (2012-2013)
* **reMail â†’ Google â†’ Shutdown** (2010-2011)
* **Mailbox â†’ Dropbox â†’ Shutdown** (2013-2015)
* **Accompli â†’ Microsoft â†’ Shutdown** (became Outlook Mobile)
* **Acompli â†’ Microsoft â†’ Integrated** (rare success)

### Email Infrastructure Consolidation

* **Postbox â†’ eM Client** (2024): Postbox immediately shut down after acquisition
* **Multiple acquisitions**: ImprovMX has been acquired multiple times
* **Service degradation**: Many services get worse after acquisition


## The Open-Source Email Graveyard: When "Free" Isn't Sustainable

### Nylas Mail â†’ Mailspring: The Fork That Couldn't

* **Nylas Mail**: Open-source email client, discontinued 2017
* **Mailspring**: Community fork, struggling with maintenance
* **Reality**: Open-source email clients can't compete with native apps

### Eudora: The 18-Year Death March

* **1988-2006**: Dominant email client for Mac/Windows
* **2006**: Qualcomm stopped development
* **2007**: Open-sourced as "Eudora OSE"
* **2010**: Project abandoned
* **Lesson**: Even successful email clients eventually die

### FairEmail: Killed by Google Play Politics

* **FairEmail**: Privacy-focused Android email client
* **Google Play**: Banned for "violating policies"
* **Reality**: Platform policies can kill email apps instantly

### The Maintenance Problem

Open-source email projects fail because:

* **Complexity**: Email protocols are complex to implement correctly
* **Security**: Constant security updates required
* **Compatibility**: Must work with all email providers
* **Resources**: Volunteer developers can't sustain enterprise-level software


## The AI Email Startup Surge: History Repeating with "Intelligence"

### The Current AI Email Gold Rush

2024's AI email startups:

* **Superhuman**: $33M raised, AI features on Gmail
* **Shortwave**: Y Combinator, Gmail + AI
* **SaneBox**: AI email filtering (actually profitable)
* **Boomerang**: AI scheduling and responses
* **[Mail-0/Zero](https://github.com/Mail-0/Zero)**: AI-powered email client startup building yet another email interface
* **[Inbox Zero](https://github.com/elie222/inbox-zero)**: Open-source AI email assistant attempting to automate email management

### The Funding Frenzy

VCs are throwing money at "AI + Email":

* **$100M+** invested in AI email startups in 2024
* **Same promises**: "Revolutionary email experience"
* **Same problems**: Building on top of existing infrastructure
* **Same outcome**: Most will fail within 3 years

### Why They'll All Fail (Again)

1. **AI doesn't solve email's non-problems**: Email works fine
2. **Gmail already has AI**: Smart replies, priority inbox, spam filtering
3. **Privacy concerns**: AI requires reading all your emails
4. **Cost structure**: AI processing is expensive, email is commodity
5. **Network effects**: Can't break Gmail/Outlook dominance

### The Inevitable Outcome

* **2025-2026**: Most AI email startups will pivot or shut down
* **2027**: Survivors will be acquired and shut down
* **2028**: "Blockchain email" will be the next trend


## The Consolidation Catastrophe: When "Survivors" Become Disasters

### The Great Email Service Consolidation

The email industry has consolidated dramatically:

* **ActiveCampaign acquired Postmark** (2022)
* **Sinch acquired Mailgun** (2021)
* **Twilio acquired SendGrid** (2019)
* **Multiple ImprovMX acquisitions** (ongoing)

### Outlook: The "Survivor" That Can't Stop Breaking

Microsoft Outlook, despite being a "survivor," has constant issues:

* **Memory leaks**: Outlook consumes gigabytes of RAM
* **Sync problems**: Emails disappear and reappear randomly
* **Performance issues**: Slow startup, frequent crashes
* **Compatibility problems**: Breaks with third-party email providers

**Our Real-World Experience**: We regularly help customers whose Outlook setups break our perfectly compliant IMAP implementation.

### The Postmark Infrastructure Problem

After ActiveCampaign's acquisition:

* **SSL Certificate Failure**: [Nearly 10-hour outage in September 2024](https://postmarkapp.com/blog/outbound-smtp-outage-on-september-15-2024) due to expired SSL certificates
* **User Rejections**: [Marc KÃ¶hlbrugge getting rejected](https://x.com/marckohlbrugge/status/1935041134729769379) despite legitimate usage
* **Developer Exodus**: [@levelsio stating "Amazon SES is our last hope"](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1934197733989999084)
* **MailGun Issues**: [Scott reported](https://x.com/_SMBaxter/status/1934175626375704675): "The worst service from @Mail\_Gun... we've not been able to send emails for 2 weeks"

### Recent Email Client Casualties (2024-2025)

**Postbox â†’ eM Client Acquisition**: In 2024, eM Client acquired Postbox and [immediately shut it down](https://www.postbox-inc.com/), forcing thousands of users to migrate.

**Canary Mail Issues**: Despite Sequoia backing, users report [non-working features](https://www.reddit.com/r/email/comments/canary_mail_problems/) and poor customer support.

**Spark by Readdle**: Users increasingly report [poor experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/spark_email_issues/) with the email client.

**Mailbird Licensing Problems**: Windows users face [licensing issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mailbird/comments/licensing_problems/) and subscription confusion.

**Airmail Decline**: The Mac/iOS email client, based on the failed Sparrow codebase, continues to receive [poor reviews](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airmail-5/id1373753865) for reliability issues.

### Email Extension and Service Acquisitions

**HubSpot Sidekick â†’ Discontinued**: HubSpot's email tracking extension was [discontinued in 2016](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email/hubspot-sidekick-sunset-faq) and replaced with "HubSpot Sales."

**Engage for Gmail â†’ Retired**: Salesforce's Gmail extension was [retired in June 2024](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000394547\&type=1), forcing users to migrate to other solutions.

### The Survivors: Email Companies That Actually Work

Not all email companies fail. Here are the ones that actually work:

**Mailmodo**: [Y Combinator success story](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mailmodo) that raised [$2M from Sequoia's Surge](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/mailmodo-raises-2m-to-bring-interactive-emails-to-marketers/) by focusing on interactive email campaigns.

**Mixmax**: Raised [$13.3M total funding](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mixmax) and continues operating as a successful sales engagement platform.

**Outreach.io**: Reached [$1.33B+ valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/outreach-raises-65m-series-f/) and is preparing for potential IPO as a sales engagement platform.

**Apollo.io**: Achieved [$1.6B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/28/apollo-raises-100m-series-d/) with $100M Series D in 2023 for their sales intelligence platform.

**GMass**: Bootstrap success story generating [$140K/month](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/gmass) as a Gmail extension for email marketing.

**Streak CRM**: Successful Gmail-based CRM that's been operating [since 2012](https://www.streak.com/about) without major issues.

**ToutApp**: Successfully [acquired by Marketo in 2017](https://blog.marketo.com/2017/05/marketo-acquires-toutapp.html) after raising $15M+ in funding.

**Bananatag**: [Acquired by Staffbase in 2021](https://staffbase.com/blog/staffbase-acquires-bananatag/) and continues operating as "Staffbase Email."

**Key Pattern**: These companies succeed because they **enhance existing email workflows** rather than trying to replace email entirely. They build tools that work **with** email infrastructure, not against it.
